In the context of Python, it allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that is specific to their own class. This enables you to write more flexible and dynamic code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how polymorphism works in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1. Different objects, same method name: You can have different classes that all define a method with the same name.\n",

        "There are a few ways polymorphism is achieved in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Duck Typing: This is a core concept in Python. If an object \"walks like a duck and quacks like a duck,\" then Python treats it like a duck. This means that if different objects have methods with the same name, you can call that method without needing to know the exact type of the object, as long as the method exists.\n",

        "\n",
        " How Encapsulation Works :\n",

        "Example of Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation in Python is like having a bank account system where your account balance (data) is kept private. You can't directly change your balance by accessing the account database. Instead, the bank provides you with methods (functions) like deposit and withdraw to modify your balance safely.\n",

        " - Definition: A class method is bound to the class and receives the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named cls.\n",

        "Ans:-A property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods in a class that behave like attributes. This provides a way to manage the access to instance attributes (getting, setting, and deleting) without needing to explicitly call methods.\n",

        "1. The @property decorator:\n",
        "\n",
        " When you apply the @property decorator to a method, that method becomes a \"getter\" for an attribute with the same name as the method. This means you can access the method's return value as if it were a simple attribute.\n",

        " 2. Defining setters and deleters:\n",
        "\n",
        "  To control how the attribute is set or deleted, you can define corresponding \"setter\" and \"deleter\" methods using the\n",

        "Benefits of using @property:\n",

        "Ans:-In Python, the super() function is primarily used in the context of inheritance. Its main significance is to provide a way to call methods defined in the superclass (parent class) from within a subclass (child class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Calling Superclass Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " The most common use of super() is to call the __init__ method of the superclass from the __init__ method of the subclass. This ensures that the superclass's attributes are properly initialized when a subclass object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Accessing Superclass Functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " super() allows you to access other methods of the superclass as well. This is useful when you want to extend or modify the behavior of a superclass method in the subclass, but still want to use the original functionality.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:-The ____del____ method in Python, also known as the destructor, is a special method that gets called when an object is about to be garbage collected (i.e., when the object is no longer referenced). Its significance lies in performing cleanup operations before an object is destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Resource Cleanup: The primary purpose of ____del____ is to release external resources that the object might be holding.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " This includes things like:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Closing file handles\n",

        " - Releasing memory or other resources allocated by the object\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Finalization: It allows you to perform finalization tasks before the object's memory is reclaimed. This could involve saving data, logging information, or performing any other actions necessary before the object ceases to exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Unpredictable Execution: It's important to note that the timing of __del__ calls can be unpredictable. Python's garbage collector determines when objects are no longer needed and when to call their __del__ method. This means you cannot rely on __del__ being called immediately after an object is no longer referenced.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Potential Issues: Due to the unpredictable nature of garbage collection and __del__ calls, using __del__ for critical resource management can sometimes lead to issues. It's generally recommended to use context managers (with the with statement) for reliable resource cleanup when possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is significant for cleaning up resources and performing finalization tasks when an object is about to be destroyed. However, its unpredictable execution timing means it should be used with caution for critical resource management, and context managers are often a more reliable alternative."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:-Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where you call multiple methods on an object in a single line of code. Each method in the chain returns the object itself, or a modified version of the object, allowing you to call the next method directly on the result of the previous one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it typically works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Methods return self: For method chaining to work, the methods you want to chain must return the instance of the class (self) after they perform their operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Consecutive calls: You can then call another method on the returned object, and continue chaining as long as each method returns an object that supports the next method call.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits of Method Chaining:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Readability: It can make your code more concise and easier to read, especially when performing a sequence of operations on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Fluent Interface: It can create a more \"fluent\" interface for your classes, making them feel more natural to use.\n",

        " s to store intermediate results.\n",

        "When to use Method Chaining:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is particularly useful when:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The methods you are chaining are modifying the state of the object.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. How it Works:\n",
        "\n",
        " When you call an object instance (e.g., my_object(arg1, arg2)) and the class of that object has a __call__ method, Python internally executes the __call__ method of that object. The arguments passed in the parentheses are passed to the __call__ method.\n",
