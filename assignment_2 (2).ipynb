If strings were mutable, one thread could change the string, potentially causing unexpected behavior in other threads.\n",

        " - Hashing: Strings are often used as keys in dictionaries, and immutability is a requirement for dictionary keys. Dictionary keys need to be hashable, which means they have a fixed hash value. If strings were mutable, their hash value could change, breaking the dictionary's internal structure.\n",

        " 1. Average Case: O(1) - Constant Time Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables. This underlying structure enables extremely fast access to elements. When you use a key to retrieve a value from a dictionary, Python applies a hash function to the key to compute an index into an array where the value is stored. This lookup process typically takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the dictionary's size.\n",

Worst Case: O(n) - Linear Time While dictionaries are designed for efficiency, there's a theoretical worst-case scenario where access time becomes linear (proportional to the number of elements). This happens when there are many collisions – multiple keys hashing to the same index in the hash table. However, Python employs techniques like collision resolution and hash table resizing to mitigate this, making the worst-case scenario relatively rare in practice.\n",
